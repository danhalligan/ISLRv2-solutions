# Linear Regression

## Conceptual

### Question 1

> Describe the null hypotheses to which the p-values given in Table 3.4
> correspond. Explain what conclusions you can draw based on these p-values.
> Your explanation should be phrased in terms of `sales`, `TV`, `radio`, and
> `newspaper`, rather than in terms of the coefficients of the linear model.

For intercept, that $\beta_0 = 0$
For the others, that $\beta_n = 0$ (for $n = 1, 2, 3$)

We can conclude that that without any spending, there are still some sales (the
intercept is not 0). Furthermore, we can conclude that money spent on TV and
radio are significantly associated with increased sales, but the same cannot be
said of newspaper spending.

### Question 2

> Carefully explain the differences between the KNN classifier and KNN
> regression methods.

The KNN classifier is categorical and assigns a value based on the most
frequent observed category among $K$ nearest neighbors, whereas KNN regression
assigns a continuous variable, the average of the response variables for
the $K$ nearest neighbors.

### Question 3

> Suppose we have a data set with five predictors, $X_1$ = GPA, $X_2$ = IQ,
> $X_3$ = Level (1 for College and 0 for High School), $X_4$ = Interaction
> between GPA and IQ, and $X_5$ = Interaction between GPA and Level. The
> response is starting salary after graduation (in thousands of dollars).
> Suppose we use least squares to fit the model, and get $\hat\beta_0 = 50$,
> $\hat\beta_1 = 20$, $\hat\beta_2 = 0.07$, $\hat\beta_3 = 35$, $\hat\beta_4 =
> 0.01$, $\hat\beta_5 = -10$.

> a. Which answer is correct, and why?

```{r}
model <- function(gpa, iq, college) {
  50 +
  gpa * 20 +
  iq * 0.07 +
  college * 35 +
  gpa * iq * 0.01 +
  gpa * gender * -10
}
x <- seq(1, 5, length = 10)
y <- seq(1, 200, length = 20)
college <- t(outer(x, y, model, college = 0))
high_school <- t(outer(x, y, model, college = 1))

library(plotly)
plot_ly(x = x, y = y) |>
  add_surface(
    z = ~college,
    colorscale = list(c(0, 1), c("rgb(107,184,214)", "rgb(0,90,124)")),
    colorbar = list(title = "College")) |>
  add_surface(
    z = ~high_school,
    colorscale = list(c(0, 1), c("rgb(255,112,184)", "rgb(128,0,64)")),
    colorbar = list(title = "High school")) |>
  layout(scene = list(
    xaxis = list(title = "GPA"),
    yaxis = list(title = "IQ"),
    zaxis = list(title = "Salary")))
```

Option iii is the correct answer.

> b. Predict the salary of a college graduate with IQ of 110 and a GPA of 4.0.

```{r}
model(gpa = 4, iq = 110, college = 1)
```

> c. True or false: Since the coefficient for the GPA/IQ interaction term is
>    very small, there is very little evidence of an interaction effect. Justify
>    your answer.

This is false. It is important to remember that GPA and IQ vary over different
scales. It is better to explicitly test the significance of the interaction 
effect, and/or visualize or quantify the effect on sales under realistic ranges
of GPA/IQ values.

### Question 4

You would expect the cubic regression to have lower RSS since it is at least
as flexible as the linear regression.

> b. Answer (a) using test rather than training RSS.

Though we could not be certain, the test RSS would likely be higher due to
overfitting.

> c. Suppose that the true relationship between $X$ and $Y$ is not linear, but
>    we don't know how far it is from linear. Consider the training RSS for the

>    Would we expect one to be lower than the other, would we expect them to be
>    the same, or is there not enough information to tell? Justify your answer.

You would expect the cubic regression to have lower RSS since it is at least
as flexible as the linear regression.

> d. Answer (c) using test rather than training RSS.

There is not enough information to tell, it depends on how non-linear the 
true relationship is.

### Question 5

> Consider the fitted values that result from performing linear regression
> without an intercept. In this setting, the ith fitted value takes the form
> $$\hat{y}_i = x_i\hat\beta,$$
> where
> $$\hat{\beta} = \left(\sum_{i=1}^nx_iy_i\right) / \left(\sum_{i' = 1}^n x^2_{i'}\right).$$

$$
\begin{align}
\hat{y}_i &= x_i \frac{\sum_{i=1}^nx_iy_i}{\sum_{i' = 1}^n x^2_{i'}} \\
          & = x_i \frac{\sum_{i'=1}^nx_{i'}y_{i'}}{\sum_{i'' = 1}^n x^2_{i''}} \\
          & = \frac{\sum_{i'=1}^n x_i x_{i'}y_{i'}}{\sum_{i'' = 1}^n x^2_{i''}} \\
          & = \sum_{i'=1}^n  \frac{ x_i x_{i'}y_{i'}}{\sum_{i'' = 1}^n x^2_{i''}} \\
          & = \sum_{i'=1}^n  \frac{ x_i x_{i'}}{\sum_{i'' = 1}^n x^2_{i''}} y_{i'}
\end{align}
$$
therefore,

$$
a_{i'} = \frac{ x_i x_{i'}}{\sum x^2}
$$

### Question 6

> Using (3.4), argue that in the case of simple linear regression, the
> least squares line always passes through the point $(\bar{x}, \bar{y})$.

when $x = \bar{x}$ what is $y$?

$$
\begin{align}
y &= \hat\beta_0 + \hat\beta_1\bar{x} \\
  &= \bar{y} - \hat\beta_1\bar{x} + \hat\beta_1\bar{x} \\
  &= \bar{y}
\end{align}
$$

### Question 7

> It is claimed in the text that in the case of simple linear regression
> of $Y$ onto $X$, the $R^2$ statistic (3.17) is equal to the square of the
> correlation between $X$ and $Y$ (3.18). Prove that this is the case. For
> simplicity, you may assume that $\bar{x} = \bar{y} = 0$.

We have the following equations:

$$ R^2 = \frac{\textit{TSS} - \textit{RSS}}{\textit{TSS}} $$
$$ Cor(x,y) = \frac{\sum_i (x_i-\bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})}{\sqrt{\sum_i(x_i - \bar{x})^2}\sqrt{\sum_i(y_i - \bar{y})^2}} $$

As above, its important to remember $\sum_i x_i = \sum_j x_j$

when $\bar{x} = \bar{y} = 0$
$$ Cor(x,y)^2 = \frac{(\sum_ix_iy_i)^2}{\sum_ix_i^2 \sum_iy_i^2} $$

Also note that:

$$\hat{y}_i = \hat\beta_o + \hat\beta_1x_i = x_i\frac{\sum_j{x_jy_j}}{\sum_jx_j^2}$$

Therefore, given that $RSS = \sum_i(y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2$ and
$\textit{TSS} = \sum_i(y_i - \bar{y})^2 = \sum_iy_i^2$

$$
\begin{align}
R^2 &= \frac{\sum_iy_i^2 - \sum_i(y_i - x_i\frac{\sum_j{x_jy_j}}{\sum_jx_j^2})^2}
            {\sum_iy_i^2} \\

    &= \frac{\sum_iy_i^2 - \sum_i(
          y_i^2 -
          2y_ix_i\frac{\sum_j{x_jy_j}}{\sum_jx_j^2} +
          x_i^2 (\frac{\sum_j{x_jy_j}}{\sum_jx_j^2})^2
        )}{\sum_iy_i^2} \\

    &= \frac{
          2\sum_i(y_ix_i\frac{\sum_j{x_jy_j}}{\sum_jx_j^2}) -
          \sum_i(x_i^2 (\frac{\sum_j{x_jy_j}}{\sum_jx_j^2})^2)
        }{\sum_iy_i^2} \\

    &= \frac{
          2\sum_i(y_ix_i) \frac{\sum_j{x_jy_j}}{\sum_jx_j^2} -
          \sum_i(x_i^2) \frac{(\sum_j{x_jy_j})^2}{(\sum_jx_j^2)^2}
        }{\sum_iy_i^2} \\

    &= \frac{
          2\frac{(\sum_i{x_iy_i})^2}{\sum_jx_j^2} -
          \frac{(\sum_i{x_iy_i})^2}{\sum_jx_j^2}
        }{\sum_iy_i^2} \\

    &= \frac{(\sum_i{x_iy_i})^2}{\sum_ix_i^2 \sum_iy_i^2}
\end{align}
$$

## Applied

### Question 8

> This question involves the use of simple linear regression on the Auto
> data set.
>
> a. Use the `lm()` function to perform a simple linear regression with `mpg` as
>   the response and `horsepower` as the predictor. Use the `summary()` function
>   to print the results. Comment on the output. For example:
>   i. Is there a relationship between the predictor and the response?
>   ii. How strong is the relationship between the predictor and the response?
>   iii. Is the relationship between the predictor and the response positive or
>        negative?
>   iv. What is the predicted mpg associated with a horsepower of 98?
>   v. What are the associated 95% confidence and prediction intervals?

```{r}
library(ISLR2)
fit <- lm(mpg ~ horsepower, data = Auto)
summary(fit)
```

Yes, there is a significant relationship between predictor and response. For
every unit increase in horsepower, mpg reduces by 0.16 (a negative
relationship).

```{r}
predict(fit, data.frame(horsepower = 98), interval = "confidence")
predict(fit, data.frame(horsepower = 98), interval = "prediction")
```

> b. Plot the response and the predictor. Use the `abline()` function to display
>   the least squares regression line.

```{r}
plot(Auto$horsepower, Auto$mpg)
abline(fit)
```

> c. Use the `plot()` function to produce diagnostic plots of the least squares
>   regression fit. Comment on any problems you see with the fit.

```{r}
par(mfrow = c(2, 2))
plot(fit, cex = 0.2)
```

The residuals show a trend with respect to the fitted values suggesting a
non-linear relationship.

### Question 9

> This question involves the use of multiple linear regression on the `Auto`
> data set.
>
> a. Produce a scatterplot matrix which includes all of the variables in the
>    data set.

```{r}
pairs(Auto, cex = 0.2)
```

> b. Compute the matrix of correlations between the variables using the function
>    `cor()`. You will need to exclude the name variable, `name` which is
>    qualitative.

```{r}
x <- subset(Auto, select = -name)
cor(x)
```

> c. Use the `lm()` function to perform a multiple linear regression with `mpg`
>    as the response and all other variables except name as the predictors. Use 
>    the `summary()` function to print the results. Comment on the output. For

>    i. Is there a relationship between the predictors and the response?
>    ii. Which predictors appear to have a statistically significant relationship
>       to the response?
>    iii. What does the coefficient for the `year` variable suggest?

```{r}
fit <- lm(mpg ~ ., data = x)
summary(fit)
```

Yes, there is a relationship between some predictors and response, notably
"displacement" (positive), "weight" (negative), "year" (positive) and
"origin" (positive).

The coefficient for year (which is positive $~0.75$) suggests that mpg
increases by about this amount every year on average.

> d. Use the `plot()` function to produce diagnostic plots of the linear
>    regression fit. Comment on any problems you see with the fit. Do the
>    residual plots suggest any unusually large outliers? Does the leverage plot
>    identify any observations with unusually high leverage?

```{r}
par(mfrow = c(2, 2))
plot(fit, cex = 0.2)
```

One point has high leverage, the residuals also show a trend with fitted values.

> e. Use the `*` and `:` symbols to fit linear regression models with
>    interaction effects. Do any interactions appear to be statistically
>    significant?

```{r}
summary(lm(mpg ~ . + weight:horsepower, data = x))
summary(lm(mpg ~ . + acceleration:horsepower, data = x))
summary(lm(mpg ~ . + cylinders:weight, data = x))
```

There are at least three cases where the interactions appear to be highly
significant.

> f. Try a few different transformations of the variables, such as $log(X)$,
>    $\sqrt{X}$, $X^2$. Comment on your findings.

```{r}
# considering just horsepower.
par(mfrow = c(2, 2))
plot(Auto$horsepower, Auto$mpg, cex = 0.2)
plot(log(Auto$horsepower), Auto$mpg, cex = 0.2)
plot(sqrt(Auto$horsepower), Auto$mpg, cex = 0.2)
plot(Auto$horsepower ^ 2, Auto$mpg, cex = 0.2)

x <- subset(Auto, select = -name)
x$horsepower <- log(x$horsepower)
fit <- lm(mpg ~ ., data = x)
summary(fit)
par(mfrow = c(2, 2))
plot(fit, cex = 0.2)
```

A log transformation of horsepower appears to give a more linear relationship
with mpg.

### Question 10

```{r}
fit <- lm(Sales ~ Price + Urban + US, data = Carseats)
```

```{r}
summary(fit)
```

> c. Write out the model in equation form, being careful to handle the

$$
\textit{Sales} = 13 + -0.054 \times \textit{Price} + \begin{cases}
   -0.022,   & \text{if $\textit{Urban}$ is Yes, $\textit{US}$ is No} \\
    1.20,    & \text{if $\textit{Urban}$ is No, $\textit{US}$ is Yes} \\
    1.18,    & \text{if $\textit{Urban}$ and $\textit{US}$ is Yes} \\
    0,       & \text{Otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$

> d. For which of the predictors can you reject the null hypothesis
>    $H_0 : \beta_j = 0$?

Price and US (Urban shows no significant difference between "No" and "Yes")

> e. On the basis of your response to the previous question, fit a smaller model
>    that only uses the predictors for which there is evidence of association
>    with the outcome.

```{r}
fit2 <- lm(Sales ~ Price + US, data = Carseats)
```

> f. How well do the models in (a) and (e) fit the data?

```{r}
summary(fit)
summary(fit2)
anova(fit, fit2)
```

They have similar $R^2$ and the model containing the extra variable "Urban" is
non-significantly better.

> g. Using the model from (e), obtain 95% confidence intervals for the

Yes, somewhat.

### Question 11

```

> a. Perform a simple linear regression of `y` onto `x`, without an intercept.

```{r}
fit <- lm(y ~ x + 0)
coef(summary(fit))
```

There's a significant positive relationship between $y$ and $x$. $y$ values are
predicted to be (a little below) twice the $x$ values.

> b. Now perform a simple linear regression of `x` onto `y` without an intercept,
>    and report the coefficient estimate, its standard error, and the

```{r}
fit <- lm(x ~ y + 0)
coef(summary(fit))
```

There's a significant positive relationship between $x$ and $y$. $x$ values are
predicted to be (a little below) half the $y$ values.

> c. What is the relationship between the results obtained in (a) and (b)?

Without error, the coefficients would be the inverse of each other (2 and 1/2).
The t-statistic and p-values are the same.

$$ \beta = \sum_i x_i y_i / \sum_{i'} x_{i'}^2 ,$$

therefore

$$
\begin{align}
t &= \frac{\sum_i x_i y_i \sqrt{n-1} \sqrt{\sum_ix_i^2}}
          {\sum_i x_i^2 \sqrt{\sum_i(y_i - x_i \beta)^2}} \\

  &= \frac{\sum_i x_i y_i \sqrt{n-1}}
          {\sqrt{\sum_ix_i^2 \sum_i(y_i - x_i \beta)^2}} \\


  &= \frac{\sum_i x_i y_i \sqrt{n-1}}
          {\sqrt{
            \sum_ix_i^2
            \sum_i(y_i^2 - 2 y_i x_i \beta + x_i^2 \beta^2)
           }} \\

  &= \frac{\sum_i x_i y_i \sqrt{n-1}}
          {\sqrt{
            \sum_ix_i^2 \sum_iy_i^2 -
            \beta \sum_ix_i^2 (2 \sum_i y_i x_i -\beta \sum_i x_i^2)
           }} \\

  &= \frac{\sum_i x_i y_i \sqrt{n-1}}
          {\sqrt{
            \sum_ix_i^2 \sum_iy_i^2 -
            \sum_i x_i y_i (2 \sum_i y_i x_i - \sum_i x_i y_i)
           }} \\

  &= \frac{\sum_i x_i y_i \sqrt{n-1}}
          {\sqrt{
            \sum_ix_i^2 \sum_iy_i^2 -
            (\sum_i x_i y_i)^2
           }} \\
\end{align}
$$

We can show this numerically in R by computing $t$ using the above equation.

```{r}
n <- length(x)
sqrt(n - 1) * sum(x * y) / sqrt(sum(x ^ 2) * sum(y ^ 2) - sum(x * y) ^ 2)
```

> e. Using the results from (d), argue that the *t*-statistic for the

Swapping $x_i$ for $y_i$ in the formula for $t$ will give the same result.

### Question 14

> This problem focuses on the collinearity problem.
>
> a. Perform the following commands in R :
>    
>    ```r
>    > set.seed(1)
>    > x1 <- runif(100)
>    > x2 <- 0.5 * x1 + rnorm(100) / 10
>    > y <- 2 + 2 * x1 + 0.3 * x2 + rnorm(100)
>    ```
>
>    The last line corresponds to creating a linear model in which `y` is a
>    function of `x1` and `x2`. Write out the form of the linear model. What are
>    the regression coefficients?
>
> b. What is the correlation between `x1` and `x2`? Create a scatterplot
>    displaying the relationship between the variables.
>
> c. Using this data, fit a least squares regression to predict `y` using `x1`
>    and `x2`. Describe the results obtained. What are $\hat\beta_0$,
>    $\hat\beta_1$, and $\hat\beta_2$? How do these relate to the true $\beta_0$,
>    $\beta_1$, and \beta_2$? Can you reject the null hypothesis $H_0 : \beta_1$
>    = 0$? How about the null hypothesis $H_0 : \beta_2 = 0$?
>
> d. Now fit a least squares regression to predict `y` using only `x1`. Comment
>    on your results. Can you reject the null hypothesis $H 0 : \beta_1 = 0$?
>
> e. Now fit a least squares regression to predict `y` using only `x2`. Comment
>    on your results. Can you reject the null hypothesis $H_0 : \beta_1 = 0$?
>
> f. Do the results obtained in (c)--(e) contradict each other? Explain your
>    answer.
>
> g. Now suppose we obtain one additional observation, which was unfortunately
>    mismeasured.
>    ```r
>    > x1 <- c(x1, 0.1)
>    > x2 <- c(x2, 0.8)
>    > y <- c(y, 6)
>    ```
>    Re-fit the linear models from (c) to (e) using this new data. What effect
>    does this new observation have on the each of the models? In each model, is
>    this observation an outlier? A high-leverage point? Both? Explain your
>    answers.

### Question 15

> This problem involves the `Boston` data set, which we saw in the lab for this
> chapter. We will now try to predict per capita crime rate using the other
> variables in this data set. In other words, per capita crime rate is the
> response, and the other variables are the predictors.
>
> a. For each predictor, fit a simple linear regression model to predict the
>    response. Describe your results. In which of the models is there a
>    statistically significant association between the predictor and the
>    response? Create some plots to back up your assertions.
>
> b. Fit a multiple regression model to predict the response using all of the
>    predictors. Describe your results. For which predictors can we reject the
>    null hypothesis $H_0 : \beta_j = 0$?
>
> c. How do your results from (a) compare to your results from (b)? Create a
>    plot displaying the univariate regression coefficients from (a) on the
>    $x$-axis, and the multiple regression coefficients from (b) on the
>    $y$-axis. That is, each predictor is displayed as a single point in the
>    plot. Its coefficient in a simple linear regression model is shown on the
>    x-axis, and its coefficient estimate in the multiple linear regression
>    model is shown on the y-axis.
>
> d. Is there evidence of non-linear association between any of the predictors
>    and the response? To answer this question, for each predictor X, fit a
>    model of the form 
>    $$
>    Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1X + \beta_2X^2 + \beta_3X^3 + \epsilon
>    $$
